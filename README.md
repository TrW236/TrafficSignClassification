## Data Set Summary & Exploration

### 1. Summary for Training Data

* The shape of the images is (32, 32, 3). 

* The data set for training has 34799 images.

* The data set for validation has 4410 images.

* The data set for test has 12630 images.

* The number of classes is 43.

The training data can be found on this website. [[link]](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)

### 2. Exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Some examples of the training data is shown below:

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data distributes. `X-axis` is the labels and `y-axis` is the number of images of every label.

## Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

### 1. Data preprocessing

* Firstly the images are cropped from size 32x32 to 28x28. 
Because I think that this process will reduce the influence of the background, 
so that the neural network can focus more on the patterns in the middle of the images.

* Secondly the images are stretched according to their lightness. 
I firstly convert the images from RGB format to HLS format, 
then I stretched the L channel to enhance the contrast. 
At the end I changed the images from HLS back to RGB, so that the color information is preserved.

* Finally I normalized the images so that the range of numbers is changed from [0, 255] to [-1, 1].

Below is an example of the preprocessing.

### 2. Data Augmentation

I randomly changed the lightness, rotation and do some shears of the images. 
So that the training data will be more generalized.

Below is the test of the data augmentation.

The number of training data will be much more.

## Neural Network

### 1. Architecture of the model

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 28x28x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 24x24x16	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 12x12x16 				|
| Convolution 5x5	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 8x8x32 	|
| RELU			        |     									        |
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 4x4x32 				    |
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, SAME padding, outputs 4x4x64	    |
| RELU			        |     									        |
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 2x2x64 				    |
| Flatten   	      	| 256 				                            |
| Dropout   	      	|  				                                |
| Fully Connected     	| 128				    |
| RELU			        |     									        |
| Dropout   	      	|  				                                |
| Fully Connected     	| 84 				    |
| RELU			        |     									        |
| Dropout   	      	|  				                                |
| Logits     	| 43 				    |

### 2. Training the model

I used AdamOptimizer with learning rate 0.001, Batch size 128, 
keep percentage 50% for the dropout layer. 
I trained and retrained the model altogether for 20 epochs.

The accuracy of training and validation is below.

### 3. Discussion to reach a high accuracy of validation

My final model results were:

* training set accuracy of 99.3%

* validation set accuracy of 98.5% 

* test set accuracy of 96.5%

The approaches
 
 1. Tried to overfit the training data using complexer neural network
 
 2. Tried to use techniques to reduce the overfitting. These include:

    * Augment the training data. 
 
    * Using max pooling and dropout layers.
 
    * Shuffle the training data more.

## Test the Model on New Images

### 1. Test the model on test data

Below is some visual exploration of the test data.

<img src="https://filedn.com/lUE8ye7yWpzFOF1OFLVsPau/Github/TrafficSignClassifier/pics/test_data_sum.png" alt="test data summary" width="488">

The total test accuracy is about 96.5%. And I have chosen the first 20 test images to predict. The result is below.

### 2. Predict traffic signs found on the web.

Here are some images that I found on the web:

<img src="https://filedn.com/lUE8ye7yWpzFOF1OFLVsPau/Github/TrafficSignClassifier/pics/pics_web.png" alt="test data from web" width="888">

The first three signs are easy to recognize because the neural network is trained for those patterns. 
And the last five patterns are false recognized because that the neural network has not been trained for those patterns.

Interesting is that, the neural network recognized the fifth picture with sure percentage about 98% as 'STOP' sign, 
because of the red color of the pattern and some letters in the pattern and the preprocessing (Scaling) of the image, 
so that the computer sees them as very similar.

The result is below.
